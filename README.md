# Bench test stand "Maria"
## Objective
Design and manufacture of an instrument for measuring propulsion parameters for rocket motor class H to K with short funds and accesible materials.

## Particular objectives
* Restrictions of desired parameters to measure (maximum and minimums)
* Statistic sounding and research
* Cost analysis of material and sensors 
* Sensors involved and individual test
* Data logging of parameters individually
* Fusion of sensors and data sampling frequency
* Data logging mixed
* Strucutral analysis proposal in function of restrictions
* Conceptual design and materials designation
* In-depth design of benchtest 
* Assembly and manufacturing considerations
* Quality control across manufacture
* Process sheet of manufacturing
* Quality assurance of manufacture
* Operations sheet procedure
* Redaction of Manual Of Use
